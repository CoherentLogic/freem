  Although I am very pleased to see the increased coverage of UNIX and
  Linux in particular, I am very concerned when I see "newbies" running
  their systems and using "root".

  I will not launch into a diatribe here, but will simply state that unless
  you need to be root (for specific system adminitration purposes, etc),
  you should NEVER use root as a working account... This is stated for more
  reasons than: "It is bad form", "It is culturally wrong", etc, etc...
  (Nor, would I suspect that a Windows NT user would insist on always doing
  everyting as "Administrator"...  basically a similar concept...  you *do*
  know better don't you, right?).

  Realize that many of the "old tapes" about "how vulnerable UNIX is" that
  you may hear are, quite frankly out of date... Things have been done to
  help the "superuser" (still an idea held in 'disrepute') be less tempting
  to use... To learn more, get the O'Reilly and Associates "Essential UNIX
  System Administration" 2E, or some other book to describe how to run your
  system...
  For yourself, and your system's sake, create a user and use that for your
  work.  Just be cause the hardware can be a PC (Play Computer), doesn't
  mean that it is limited to that role when running a real operating
  system.

Outline of setup process:

with modest knowledge of directory and file rights I tried to address
one aspect of the "multi-user" thing within my GNU Linux environment.

First: creating a new group and new user to run FreeM.

as root:

groupadd -g 1998 -o freeM 
useradd -u 1806 -g freeM -d /opt/mumps/ mgr 
mkdir /opt/mumps
chown -R mgr.freeM /opt/mumps
passwd mgr

Now I login as mgr and install FreeM-0.4.0
(/opt/mumps/FreeM-0.4.0)

Afterwards I go to FreeM-0.4.0/bin, start mumps and define a
namespace("space1")

Now I start playing "multi user".

I have a user "tester" who wants to work with the FreeM database.

++ First possibility:

adding tester to the freeM group in /etc/group ; looks like this
freeM:x:1806:tester

When tester gets a login shell next time and I type in the command
"id" I find tester also in group "1806(freeM)"

**** ****** *****
But I couldn't start up mumps from the tester account until I logged
in as mgr, went to /opt and changed

chmod -R 1770 /opt/mumps
***** who knows better ? side effects ? *******


Next: to access the namespace "space1" (defined with mgr before) from
the tester account I have to go to the directory 
/opt/mumps/FreeM-0.4.0/bin 
before starting mumps so that mumps gets the correct relative path
information. I use a 3 line script "m.login" 

#!bin/sh
cd /disk2/home/MGR/FreeM-0.4.0/bin
mumps
cd

"chmod u+x m.login" and ". m.login" starts up mumps properly.

++ Second possibility:

root issues a password for the freeM group
gpasswd freeM

I login as "testerx" who is not in the freeM group.
I get access to the FreeM database by
newgrp freeM
and giving the password. 
(According to what I have read meanwhile this way is not recommended.)
With ". m.login" (see above) I can start mumps.

At last:
when creating a global with tester the owner of that file is tester!
Example:
-rw-rw-rw-   1 tester    users        2048 Feb 16 10:43 ^cctest

But this is another chapter to be written by someone wiser than me ...
