when I use emacs to edit a file with extension ".m" in my standard
GNU Linux environment the editor assumes that I am going to work on a
"ObjC"-file and starts the appropiate cc-mode which (according to what I
experienced) by default is configured to not accecpt the "tab".

workaround:

"text-mode" is much more useful - this mode by default accepts the "tab".
To start "text-mode" automatically instead of "cc-mode" when invoking a
".m" file the follwing helped:

create a file ".emacs" in the home directory

with a line

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.m\\'" . text-mode) auto-mode-alist))


Emacs is not that uncommon within the linux scene and ".m" seems to have a
certain meaning there. So we have to face that changing the file extention
from ".mps" to ".m" has a side effect.
