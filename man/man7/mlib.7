The mlib takes advantage of the fact that FreeM will automatically run
a program named ../mlib/%LOGIN.m on startup. 

There are two globals that are used by the mlib to store information
about the system (../mlib/^%SYS) and the editor (../mlib/^%E)
They are KILLed before the FreeM distribution is built, and are
recreated when the FreeM system is started from a directory that
it had not been used in before.
