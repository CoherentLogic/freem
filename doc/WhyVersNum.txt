Version Numbering Scheme Q&A

QUESTION:
 Why are the releases being numbered like "0.n.0" (e.g., 0.5.0)???
 Sure, it hasn't been "released" yet (far from it, granted), but will the
 number be set to 1.0.0 when the first "release" goes out?  This doesn't
 make sense to me.

ANSWER:
Our numbering scheme is based on the fact that until we fulfill 
Shalom's requirements, we can't state that we have our first 
public version of FreeM. 
So we can't call it version number 1.0.0 until we do.
The third number m.n.p (ie: p) is intended to allow the private
development of versions that are not released on the coordinated
web page.

QUESTION:
If you are *working* on release "1.0", then the work-in-progress numbers
should be "1.0.nnn", where nnn=001, 002, ... until you get to an alpha
version, say, numbered 1.0.135, and a beta numbered, say, 1.0.278, and
various release candidates numbered 1.0.324, 1.0.325, 1.0.326, etc., and a
final "1.0" release numbered, say, 1.0.354.

ANSWER:
A very good synopsis of the approach taken by some. Using that analogy,
we work with the  pattern "m.nnn.0" for our work-in-progress numbers.
In the pattern, the "m" is the major version number,
and "nnn" as you state above is the work-in-progress number. 
The third digit, as I state above is for private developers' use.
