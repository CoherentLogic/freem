Discussion about FreeM and CGI.
I think there are three solutions to use FreeM as an HTML-frontend-database:

1) Native CGI
advantage is very flexible, runs with all HTTP-Servers. But its slow.

2) Write a HTTP-server in M
Some Years ago i've written an HTTP-Server in MSM. It was a very very fast
solution but FreeM doesn't support TCP/IP yet.

3) Compile FreeM as an Apache-Module
Perhaps the best solution. I have some experiences in PHP (www.php.net)
which is a programming-language embedded in HTML. 
It's very fast and static stuff like images will be deliverd by apache.
Is somebody here with experiences in writing Apache-Modules?

Note that CGI's are expected to get access to certain environment
variables (which have the header and other information from the shell)
If FreeM is invoked with the -e command line option, all environment
variables are copied into subscripts of the variable named %.
It refuses to read any environment variable which has a string 
length longer than 255 characters.
In UNIX environment variables live in the memory space of the running task. 
They get copied when a new task is launched. 
Thus each task inherits the environment space of its parent. 
If you use the shell escape you only set the variables in
the shell's memory space which goes away when it quits. (NOTE: This
discussion does not apply to the the Microsoft world which has its own
behavior.)

One possibility is Using a routine %MCGI

%MCGI    ;;
    w "CONTENT-TYPE: TEXT/HTML",!!
    w "<HTML><HEAD></HEAD><BODY>FREEM!!!</BODY></HTML>",$C(10)
    h

and invoking M with following script in cgi-bin

cd /usr/local/FreeM/FreeM-0.x.0/src/
../mumps ^%MCGI -f

i always get an internal Server-Error. Calling directly i get the output

CONTENT-TYPE: TEXT/HTML

<HTML><HEAD></HEAD><BODY>FREEM!!!</BODY></HTML>
